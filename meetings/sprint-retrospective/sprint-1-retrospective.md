# Main problems encountered
### Problem 1
Description: Interfaces were not set beforehand 

Reaction: Slowdown because of refactoring when they got specified

### Problem 2
Description: Authentication method was a bit obscure.

Reaction: Slowdown because of refactoring

### Problem 3
Description: No weight on technical issues.

Reaction: Worse understanding of amount of work done.

# Adjustments for the next Spring plan
Interface documentation has been made for some microservices, others will follow.<br>
Authentication has been discussed at length, team members now have a better understanding of what to do.<br>
Add weights to the issues. Can be used to track the amount of time spent on a task.<br>
All issues will be specified at the beginning of the sprint, including implied endpoints.
