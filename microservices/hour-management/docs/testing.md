## Testing naming convention
We decided to use the following naming convention for the tests in the authentication microservice:
```test<MethodWeWantToTest><ConditionWeWantTest>()```\
And for the classes it is in the format: ```<ClassWeWantToTest>Test.java```.

Within the test methods we use the AAA (Arrange - Act - Assert) convention, and they are clearly separated by empty lines.
